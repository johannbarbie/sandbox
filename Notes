# Goal:
1. To create a simple javascript emulator to quickly test new SMS communication patterns
2. To create a framework to display command examples on the website via javascript animations


# Questions
What is the best way to parse the value? Is there a way to make a table (array?) that will compare what is entered to a series of information?


# Logic Todo
-. basic positioning
-. store and display the sent text
-. track if first message or not
1. variables for bal, time, date, caller
3. integration with existing txt cmds
3. line breaks (from existing txt cmds)
4. Add a timebreak to responses (simulate a slow SMS system)
5. repl

# Interaction Todo
1. clear the field (sending the text & #textBox onClick)
2. persistant bubbles (that move up)
2. animation of bubbles
2. click to start chat (vs auto downloading it)
3. Look for existing javascript messenger...

# Maybe Todo
1. Suggestions of command: a box that has a list of commands to drag and drop into place "SEND 12USD 626727272" or "Help", etc.
2. auto-complete texts... users can only send a few different texts that the system predicts and fills in for them
3. transaction builder... fill in a form to create transactions (we were going to do this anyways)
